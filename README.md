# JavaScript-Basics
  JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
  JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995.
  Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.
