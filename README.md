# JavaScript-Basics

  JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
  
  JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995.
  
  Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.
  
  Achieved the status of an ECMA standard in 1997 and adopted the official name ECMAScript.

  This language has evolved through several versions, namely ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and the transformative ES6

# What kind of language the JavaScript is?

  JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
  JavaScript supports both Functional and object-oriented programming. 
  
# Data Types

**Primitive data types** are the built-in data types provided by JavaScript. They represent single values and are not mutable.
The variable may be reassigned to a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.

Below are Primitive data types: 

string
number
bigint
boolean
undefined
symbol
null

**Non Primitive data types** 

Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are objects and derived data types. They can store collections of values or more complex entities. The two key non-primitive data types in JavaScript are:

Object
Array

# JavaScript is a weekly typed language

which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors

const foo = 42; // Number
const result = foo + "1"; // Number + String does not throw error instead converted to string
console.log(result); // 421
