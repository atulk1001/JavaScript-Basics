# JavaScript-Basics

  JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
  
  JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995.
  
  Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.
  
  Achieved the status of an ECMA standard in 1997 and adopted the official name ECMAScript.

  This language has evolved through several versions, namely ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and the transformative ES6

# What kind of language the JavaScript is?

  JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
  JavaScript supports both Functional and object-oriented programming. 
  
# Data Types

**Primitive data types** are the built-in data types provided by JavaScript. They represent single values and are not mutable.
The variable may be reassigned to a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.

string

number

bigint

boolean

undefined

symbol

null

**Non Primitive data types** 

Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are objects and derived data types. They can store collections of values or more complex entities. The two key non-primitive data types in JavaScript are:

Object

Array

# JavaScript is a weekly typed language

which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors

const foo = 42; // Number

const result = foo + "1"; // Number + String does not throw error instead converted to string

console.log(result); // 421

# JavaScript Features

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)


# Advantages of Using JavaScript

**Interactivity:** dynamic content updates, animations, and real-time form validations, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Versatility:** JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used to build server-side applications, making it a versatile language for full-stack development.

**Asynchronous Programming** JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await. 

This allows developers to perform non-blocking operations, such as fetching data from a server, without freezing the user interface

**Integration with HTML and CSS:** JavaScript seamlessly integrates with HTML and CSS, allowing developers to create rich, interactive web pages. It can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update content and styles.

**Rapid Development:** JavaScript's simplicity and ease of learning make it a great choice for rapid development. Developers can quickly prototype and build applications, reducing time-to-market.


# Applications that can be built in javascript

Web Applications (React/ Angular)

Mobile Applications (React Native)

Server-Side Applications (Node.js)

Desktop Applications (Electron)

Game Development (Three.js)

Internet of Things Aka IOT (Node-RED)

Progressive Web Applications (offline, push notifications)

Automation (WebDriver.io, Selenium)

Scripting (CLI, Docker files)

Machine Learning (TensorFlow)

ChatBots (Microsoft Bot Framework)


# Disadvantages of JavaScript  

Vulnerable to security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

Since JavaScript code is executed on the client-side, bugs and oversights can sometimes be exploited for malicious purposes.

Performance limitations due to single-threaded execution.

JavaScript can be slower than server-side languages for certain tasks, especially when dealing with large computations or complex algorithms.

Inconsistencies across different browsers may require extra testing.

Debugging and troubleshooting JavaScript code can be difficult, especially in large codebases, due to its dynamic nature and lack of strict typing
